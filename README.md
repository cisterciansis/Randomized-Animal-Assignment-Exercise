# Randomized-Animal-Assignment-Exercise

### How to Use and Extend This Template

- **Understanding the Code:**  
  Read through each function and comment. Notice how the `randomize_assignments()` function builds the randomized list and how `update_table()` refreshes the GUI table.
  
- **Modifying the Randomization Logic:**  
  If you want to change how animals are assigned, try modifying the loop in `randomize_assignments()`. For example, you could change the number of extra assignments or add new treatment groups.
  
- **Enhancing the GUI:**  
  Experiment with the Tkinter and ttk styling options. Change the window size, the button fonts, or even add more widgets (like labels or menus) to improve usability.
  
- **Extending the Functionality:**  
  Consider adding features such as saving the assignment results to a file, adding error checks, or even incorporating data visualization to analyze the distribution of assignments.
